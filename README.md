# real-time-weather

Displays a 7-day weather forecast for any location.

## Objective

I created this app to test & refine the following skills:

- use React to manange app state
- use React-router to route requests
- use Parcel to bundle files
- consume two separate APIs for retrieving weather data
  - [OpenCage Geocoder API](https://opencagedata.com/api) - fetch latitude & longitude coordinates from address
  - [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev) - fetch weather data from latitude & longitude
- implement Bootstrap and use to style the page
- use GitHub as a version control system

## Getting Started

This app uses yarn, run the following to set it up.

```
yarn install
```

The app can be packaged & served for development by running:

```
yarn start:dev
```

At which point the site will be served on port 1234, which can be visited at:

```
localhost:1234
```
